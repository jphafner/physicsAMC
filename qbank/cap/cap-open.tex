\begin{question}{CAP-B-1994-q01}
    In this question we will investigate a possible navigational air for aircraft approaching an airport.
    Support at one end of the runway there are two radio transmitting towers,
        one on either side of the runway,
        separated by a distance $l=\SI{100}{\meter}$.
    The two radio towers are each transmitting a radio signal of frequency $f_0=\SI{12}{\mega\hertz}$ in phase with each other.
    An aircraft with ground speed of $v$ is flying towards the airport such that its velocity makes an angle $\theta$ with the runway as shown.
    The aircraft, still very far from the airport, has locked onto the signals and is heading directly for the midpoint of the towers.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item At the aircraft's current position, the intensity of the signal from each tower separately would be $I_0$.
            Find the intensity of the combined signal from both towers received by the aircraft for headings of $\theta=0$ and $\theta=\pi/2$.
    \end{enumerate}
