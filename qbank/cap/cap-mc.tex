        it exerts a pressure on the surface that is given by $\frac{I}{c}\cos\theta$,
        where $c$ is the speed of light and $\theta$ is the angle the light rays hit the surface relative to a direction perpendicular to the surface. 
    The Sun has a radiation power of $P=\SI{3.9e26}{\watt}$.

    The intensity of light from a source decreases with the distance $x$ from the source, as $x^{-2}$.
    In the following picture, the intensity of light from the source $S$ at point $A$ on a curtain is \SI{8.1}{U} where U is some unit. 
    We then add a big mirror parallel to the curtain at point $B$.
    The distances $AS$ and $SB$ are equal,
        and the points $A$, $S$ and $B$ are in line perpendicular to the curtain and the mirror.

    Some time after the beginning of motion in the presence of air resistance,

    Many people's glasses appear to be a glue-green color when viewed under reflected light.
    A thin film of index of refraction $n=1.35$ is applied to the outside surface of the glass so that the film/glass interface does not reflect any red light of wavelength $\lambda=\SI{630}{\nano\meter}$.
    What thickness must the film layer be in order to achieve this?
    Take the index of refraction of air and glass to be 1.0 and 1.6 respectively.

    Three identical balls are thrown from the top of a cliff and some time later land at the base of the cliff.
    Ball $A$ is thrown upwards with speed $v$, Ball $B$ is thrown downwards with speed $v$,
        and Ball $C$ is thrown at speed $v$ and at an angle of \ang{45} above the horizontal.
    Comparing the speeds, $v_A$, $v_B$, and $v_C$ with which the balls hit the ground at the base of the cliff (and ignoring air resistance), you find:
