        Filling out your Activity Guide





1) Give out the syllabus on day one.
2) Go over just what you deem necessary---perhaps the name of the text book and a listing of the materials needed for the course
3) Tell the class that there will be a syllabus quiz tomorrow worth ____ points and tell them specifically what parts of the syllabus the quiz will cover.
    (My quiz does not cover the calendar and homework assignment part of my syllabus.)
4) The next day when it is time for the quiz, put the class into small groups.
5) Give each group a copy of the syllabus quiz (see below) and give them 5 minutes to go over the questions together. 
    I let them use their syllabus!
    Tell them they will be asked to answer the questions out loud as a group.
6) After the five minutes---project the syllabus quiz so everyone can see it---and select groups to answer each question. (I have groups throw a koosh ball from group to group.)
7) When the quiz is over---give everyone who participated the designated quiz points.
8) As a result of doing this---students know the “rules of the class” and not much time is taken during class time to make this happen!
