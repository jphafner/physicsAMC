Self Test: Course Guidelines

Attendance in this course is
    optional
    required three times a week
    required once per week
    required once per module

Attendance
    does not count toward the grade
    counts for 10\% of the overall course grade

You may contact me by
    sending a private message
    using the course email
    using private email
    using Skype
    arranging a time to talk on the phone
    all of the above

Answers to the written questions at the end of each module
    should be based on the textbook only
    can be answered by pasting in text from Wikipedia
    can be answered with information from a combination of the textbook and credible web sites

Pasting in text from a web site to answer written questions is
    a great time-saver
    OK if it's from a credible or a recommended site
    allowed if you give credit to the author
    explicitly not allowed, and will result in zero points being awarded

Answering written questions using text that is verbatim (or nearly so) from the textbook is
    helpful if it answers the question exactly
    OK if you put quotations around the text
    explicitly not allowed, and will result in zero points being awarded

True or false: Answers to written assignment questions have to be composed entirely in your own words.
    True
    False

If you use information (not exact text) from the textbook or web sites to answer written assignment questions, you need to
    be thankful that you found the answers
    give the URL of the website and the page number from the textbook

The best way to earn a high grade in the discussions is to
    post a lot
    write posts that contain relevant content
    post something you think the instructor will agree with

Writing a discussion post that is based on your opinion
    can be a good way to jump into the discussion
    is especially relevant if you have direct personal or professional experience with the topic
    is not worth as many points as a more substantive post that you researched from other sources
    should not be the only type of post you make
    all of the above

If you don't like science you should
    suffer through this course and hope for a C
    try to change your personality so that you do like science

        it mostly deals with aspects of everyday life that most people find to be quite interesting
