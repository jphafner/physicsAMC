\begin{question}[ID=upwardly-A-Q01,topic=projectiles,difficulty=A]
    A golf ball with an initial angle of \SI{34}{\degree} and
        an unknown initial speed lands exactly \SI{240}{\meter}
        down the range on a level course.
    \begin{enumerate*}[label=\arabic*)]
        \item neglecting air friction, what initial speed
            would achieve this result?

\begin{question}[ID=upwardly-A-Q02,topic=projectiles,difficulty=A]
    A rocket is launched at an angle of \SI{53}{\degree} above
        the horizontal with an initial speed of
        \SI{75}{\meter\per\second}.
    It moves for \SI{25}{\second} along its initial line
        of motion with an acceleration of
        \SI{25}{\meter\per\second\squared}.
    At this time, the engines fail and the rocket proceeds to move
        a free body.
    \begin{enumerate*}[label=\arabic*)]
        \item What is the rocket's maximum altitude?
        \item What is the rocket's total time of flight?

        \SI{140}{\meter} tall building that is
        \SI{650}{\meter} away from the cannon.

        hit the building, or go over the building?

        launches a projectile at an angle of \SI{45}{\degree}
        with respect to the ground.
    The cannon is aimed towards a \SI{590}{\meter} high hill,
        which is a distance of \SI{1490}{\meter} away.
    Does the projectile strike the hill or clear the hill?
    If it strikes the hill, how high up does the hill does it
        strike?
