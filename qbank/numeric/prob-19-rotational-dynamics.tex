\begin{question}[ID=rotational-A-Q01,topic=rotational,difficulty=A]
    A regulation basketball has a \SI{25}{\centi\meter} diameter and may be
        approximated as a thin spherical shell ($I=\frac{2}{3}mR^2$).
    How long will it take a basketball starting from rest to roll
        without slipping \SI{4.0}{\meter} down an incline that makes
        an angle of \ang{30.0} with the horizontal?
\end{question}
\begin{solution}
    N/A

\begin{question}[ID=rotational-B-Q01,topic=rotational,difficulty=B]
    A \SI{1.5}{\kilo\gram} bicycle tire of radius \SI{0.33}{\meter} starts
        from rest and rolls down from the top of a hill that is \SI{14.8}{\meter} high.
    What is the translational speed of the tire when it reaches the bottom of the hill?
    (Assume that the tire is a hoop with $I=mr^2$.)

\begin{question}[ID=rotational-B-Q02,topic=rotational,difficulty=B]
    As part of a kinetic sculpture, a \SI{5.0}{\kilo\gram} hoop with a radius
        of \SI{3.0}{\meter} rolls without slipping.
    If the hoop is given an angular speed of \SI{3.0}{\radian\per\second}
        while rolling on the horizontal and then rolls up a ramp inclined
        at \ang{20.0} with the horizontal, how far does the hoop roll along the incline?
    (Moment of inertia of a hoop is $I=mr^2$.)

\begin{question}[ID=rotational-B-Q03,topic=rotational,difficulty=B]
    A coin with a diameter of \SI{3.00}{\centi\meter} rolls up a \ang{30.0} incline.
    The coin starts with an initial angular speed of \SI{60.0}{\radian\per\second}
        and rolls in a straight line without slipping.
    How far does it roll up the inclined plane?
