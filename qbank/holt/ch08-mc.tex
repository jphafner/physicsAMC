    A typical silo on a farm has many bands wrapped around its perimeter,
        as shown in the figure below.
    \begin{center}
    \end{center}
    Why is the spacing between successive bands smaller toward the bottom?
    \begin{choices}
        \wrongchoice{To provide support for the silo's sides above them}
        \wrongchoice{To resist the increasing pressure that the grains exert with increasing depth}
        \wrongchoice{To resist the increasing pressure that the atmosphere exerts with increasing depth}
        \wrongchoice{To make access to smaller quantities of grain near the ground possible}

    A fish rests on the bottom of a bucket of water while the bucket is being weighed.
    When the fish begins to swim around in the bucket,
        how does the reading on the scale change?
    \begin{choices}
        \wrongchoice{The motion of the fish causes the scale reading to increase.}
        \wrongchoice{The motion of the fish causes the scale reading to decrease.}
        \wrongchoice{The buoyant force on the fish is exerted downard on the bucket, causing the scale reading to increase.}
