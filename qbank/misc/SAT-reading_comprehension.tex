    The short story as a concise and complete tale restricted to a single efficient, and dealing for this cause with one profile, some exacting and enlightening aspect of the essential character's character in a single period is perhaps a sixteenth and seventeenth century incident in Europe. 
    It can be urbanized clearly from stories wicker into usual novels such as in Don Quixote, Cervantes and in Alexender Dumas, The three Musketeers, etc. 
    In the England the Doctor Jhonson's age short story method was applied to stories of teaching ethical lessons. 
    Only in the nineteenth century did it start to obtain the form that is well-known to us today. 
    Perhaps the best practioner of the short story in Europe and the man who gave it a status as a self-regulating and mythical form, was guy de Maupassant. 
    From France the structure travelled to England and Russia and was right away adopted in America Edger. 
    Allen Poe used the small story form of tales of mood and terror as well as for police man stories.
    O, Henry tuned the short to comedy and wit. 
    It was predictable that, under the pressure of English writing, when the British governed South Asia, the south form should make a way here. 
    As in other places in South Asia too, storytelling is an antique art, older than the Panchatantra and the Katha Sarit Sagar. 
    But the short story or storytelling did not grow considerably as an self-regulating form until storytelling was jerked into the current age with the work of Prem Chand, who wrote in both Urdu and Hindi languages. 
    His languages may be described, most suitably, as Hindustani, the stem from which the Persian zed modification branched out into Urdu and the Sankritised modification into Hindi. 
    The direction towards a current receptivity came from him principally and the thread was chosen up by Ismat Chugtai, who came into admired acclaim with her two volumes of short stories, Choten and Kaliaan. 
    Her stories performed in action and personality the social ways, knowledge of men women 1930 and the 1940's and, wiles. 
    Though she sustained to write for the next years and though her work retrained its vitality and pointedness, she has been measured basically as some kind of bridge between the reserved story writing of Prem Chand on the other hand and the honest and open stories of Saadat Hassan Manto and the two most famous fiction writers produced by the progressive Writers group, Krishan Chander Nd Rajinder Singh Bedi. 
    These three writers, Krishan Chander, Manto and Bedi developed the Urdu short story to its most refined level. 
    They have been newly made obtainable to the English understanding public in rendition by Mr. Jai Ratan for two section of the chosen short stories of Krishnan Chander and Rajinder Singh Bedi available by the Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi and a set of the short stories of Saadat Hhassan Mnato, The best of Maanto, in print by sterling Publishers, New Delhi.


    Among these three writers, Manto who died in 1955 at the very young age of forty three, veered diction ally to the speech used by Prem Chand, a Hindustani written in alif- bey but carrying feelings and suggestion that was a immense deal more delicate and pointed. 
    However, what Manto is recognized the most of all for are his disobedience of social gathering about what may and may not be openly stated and his liking for depicting scenes and act openly. 
    A definite section of the community, the middle class conventional who favored a gloss of ethics and stood determinedly by ossified rites and approach oppose him with all the pressure at its command, and he was pulled up a number of times on charges of obscenity. 
    If there is anything for which one may call him to account, it is that he tends irregularly to be self-consciously complete and uninhibited in his selection of themes and in the language in which he uttered himself. 
    Statements detract from finely. 
    For all this, Manto short stories evocative in some ways of Maupassant, do not make self-indulgence, envy and abuse attractive though he writes with sympathy of the nightfall planet of prostitutes and underdogs, his information and understanding of their lives, objectives and actions is visibly genuine. 
    Stories such as Toba tek Singh, Khol De, and Babu Gopinath are today nearly classics and will persist to stay applicable to The South Asian's Predicament for an elongated time.

    The study reported in the journal Nature Nano tools by a team of researchers from Massachusetts institution of Technology and children's hospital Boston promises to develop on accessible cardiactic patches, which have difficulty in attaining the level of conductivity essential to make sure and even incessant beat throughout a huge piece of tissue. 
    The heart is an electrically quite classy piece of apparatus days Robert Kohane, superior author of the paper. 
    It is significant that the cells beat jointly or the tissue won't function correctly. 
    The sole new come within reach of uses of gold nanowires sprinkled among cardiac ceels as there are developed in vitro a method that markedly improves the performance of the cardiac patch---Kohane says. 
    The researchers consider the technology may ultimately result in implantable patches to restore tissue that's been injured in a heart attack. 
    The first authors were Brian Timko and Tal Dvir. 
    To construct new tissue, engineers classically use small scaffolds similar to absorbent sponges to put in order cells into useful shapes as they develop. 
    Conventionally, however these scaffolds have been made from materials with bad quality electrical conductivity and for cardiac cells, which depend on the electrical signals to organize their contraction, that's a big difficulty. 
    In the case of cardiac myocytes in exacting, you require a good connection between the cells to get signal transmission. 
    Timko says that the gallows acts as an insulator, jamming signals from travelling much ahead of a cells urgent neighbors and making it nearly unfeasible to get all the cells to strike together as a unit. 
    To resolve the difficulty, Timko and Dvir took benefit of their corresponding backgrounds. 
    Timko is partially conducting nanowires, Dvir's in cardiac tissue business to plan a brand fresh scaffold materil that would permit electrical signals to pass from side to side. 
    We started brainstorming and it occurred to me that it's in fact fairly simple to develop gold nonoconductors, which of course are extremely conductive. 
    Timko says, you can develop them to be pair microns long, which is sufficient to pass through the walls of the scaffold. 
    The group took as their bottom material algrinate an organic gum like matter that is used for tissue scaffolds. 
    They assorted the alginate with a elucidation containing gold nanowires to make a compound scaffold with billions of the minute metal structures running in the course of it. 
    Then they seeded cardiac cells on top of the gold alginate compound, testing the conductivity of the tissue developed on the compound compared of tissue developed on pure alginate. 
    Because signals are conducted by calcium ions in and amongst the cells, the researcher could make sure how far signals travelled by observing the quantity of calcium present in unlike areas.

    On the whole calcium is how cardiac cells connect to each other, so we made the cell with a calcium marker and put the scaffold beneath the microscope. 
    Timko says, they researched on a dramatic development among cells developed on the unpolluted alginate showed transmission over only a little hundred micrometers or thousandths of a millimeter. 
    It's really night and day. 
    The performance that the scaffolds have with these nanomaterials is now much better as told by Kohane. 
    Aside from allusion for heart attack patients, Kohane adds that the victorious practice opens up a bunch of doors for engineering other types of tissue.

    Box and Cox has been called a saga of actual life in one act. 
    A romance is an imaginative story. 
    It is a colorful exaggeration. 
    The characters behave in an absurd way. 
    This play has three characters two male and one female. 
    One works in a press all hours of darkness, the other makes hat all through the day. 
    The lady rents out the similar room to two persons. 
    Box and Cox keep irritable all through. 
    They criticize of pilferage of their coal, sugar, candles and match boxes. 
    Both believe their landlady to be the equitable lodger and ask the other fellow to give up or go to the attic. 
    They eventually drag in Mrs. Bouncer and disgrace her.

    Box and Cox is a one act play.  It has just three characters.  John box is a printer.  James Cox is a hat maker.  Mrs. Bouncer is an intelligent and sharp woman.  She rents out the same room to both of them mutually.  It becomes possible because Mr. Box spends the night at the press.  He returns to his room only in the morning.  Cox being a hat maker leaves the room in the morning and returns home late evening.  Mrs. Bouncer tells either tenant that the other man lives in the attic.  Cox is ready to leave his factory.  He looks at himself in a small looking glass. His hair is very short.  It looks as if he has been first given a hair cut for the army.  He declares that he would never have his hair cut again.  A knock at the door and Mrs. Bouncer enters.  She enquires if he has had sound sleep.  He asks her to provide a bigger bolster.  He puts on his coat and then his hat.  The hat is too big for his head.  He attributes it to his close cropped hair.  Earlier the hat was tight fitting.  He tries the second and then the third hat. It wobbles less than the others.  Before he leaves he complains to Mrs. B that his coals go quite fast.  The same is true about his candles, wood, sugar and matches. She tells him not to suspect her.  But no cat says he can run away with all those things.  She asks if he has got anything else to grumble about. Cox tells her the meaning of the word grumble.  It means to complain without cause, but he has reason to complain.  He raises another issue. He wonders why his apartment is often full of smoke, not of chimney smoke but of tobacco smoke.  Mrs. B doesn't smoke herself. She directs the blame to the gentleman who lives in the attic.  This gentleman is Box, and he hardly is without a pipe on his mouth while he sits with his feet on the shelf above the fireplace.  Cox wonders how Box's feet can reach the mantel piece.  He corrects her.
    Perhaps she means that Cox sits on the metal frame around the fire or on the raised platform beside the fire. 
    There he sits for hours and puffs away into the fire place. 
    Cox is again at a loss to know how smoke instead of going up the chimney blows down into the room. He admits having seen Box, the young gentleman on the staircase. He takes leave of Mrs. B, instructing her not to light his fire in future not to forget the bolster and not to boil his milk. Mrs. B heaves a sigh of relief when Mr. Cox goes out of door. She thanks her stars that her two lodgers have not met yet. There is only one of them at a time in the room. Thus she is getting double rent for her room. She makes haste to put Mr. Cox's things out of Mr. Box's way. She puts Cox's hats, gown and slippers in the store cupboard. She puts the key on the ledge of the door. She also decides to ask Mr. Box not to smoke so much. As for the bed, the head of the bed for Mr. Cox becomes the foot of the bed for Mr. Box. This is how their taste differs so much.

    Box arrives. He is dressed as a printer. He is in a temper. This is because he is feeling, tired and sleepy. He is hungry also. His problem is to whether to take his breakfast after a short nap or before it. He enquires about the man whom he met a while before on the staircase. She reports that the gentleman lives in the attic. She also says that the gentleman objects to that Box is smoking too much. Box wants Cox to find a room in some other village. He has brought a thin slice of bacon or pork for his breakfast. He places it on the table along with two penny bread roll. He then looks for his matchbox to light the fire. He had a whole box only three days ago and now there is only one stick left in it. He suspects that Mrs. B steals his candles and his sugar. But he is shocked to learn that she steals his match sticks also. His candles also run short three parts gone. He rarely lights it because he stays at home only during day time. Finally he looks at the metal frame or gridiron. He had last cooked on it a pork cutlet. But now it smells of some fish. Anyway, he places the bacon slice on the gridiron and goes to sleep. Cox enters the room. He was about eleven minutes late for the office. While he was looking into the shop secretly with excitement, his employer did him a favor. He told Cox to have a holiday. He thought loafing about. But he was eager to have his breakfast. He too has brought a mutton cutlet. He puts it on the table. He sees a roll and calls himself lucky. He looks for the matchbox to light the fire. He finds the matchbox empty. He remembers having left one matchstick in it in the morning. He is further amazed to see alight already. He notices the gridiron on the table and place his mutton chop on the gridiron. He goes out to bring other breakfast things.

Newspapers not only give us knowledge about the old activities which may increase the awareness among the human beings and may not claim the logical involvement in that problem, but also something more than that. In fact with passage of time newspapers have grown into not only a diversion for the breakfast table but also an essential source of knowledge and the most important medium of making the people democratic in their outlook and thinking. At the earlier stages of its growth the press was just to give knowledge to the people and keep them busy to the changes in the country and the world at large. But as all medium of learning are used or misused for one or the other reason so is the case with the news papers. Many years ago Burke called the media the fourth estate and we can expediently call it the fourth significant organ of the self-governing states and others being managerial, magistrates, and government. If the press is self-governing and the reports are intent, which is of course not possible, it can keep the minds of the people open to all imitation. But now days there are subtle suggestion in the news and there is very clever distortion here and there. So, now-a-days, the primary purpose of newspapers is to color the opinion of the people. They provide the public with readymade opinions and baked ideas. The people also accept these things happily because the common man has neither the intelligence nor the time to verify the validity of the news or gather the correct opinion from other sources. Otherwise also it is the weakness of even educated people that they believe a printed word more readily than a word from mouth. Therefore, most of the people quote newspapers in order to support their contentions. Once the ideas are propagated, it is very difficult, because of the lack of resources, to sift the truth from falsehood. Consequently, people become the victim of propaganda without being conscious of this process. A free press can definitely consolidate the forces of democracy and can easily negate the influence of pulls and pressures which have been dragging the citizens away from the democratic thinking. If the news is reported objectively and the problems are analyzed with no bias, it is definitely possible to make the people think correctly.

So great is our obsession of doing things for ourselves, that we are becoming more and less reliant on specific labor. No one can beg for unawareness of a subject any further, for there are numerous to do it yourself pamphlet. Armed with the correct apparatus and materials, newlyweds gaily board on the task of decorating their own homes. Men of all ages spend lot of hours of their spare time time installing their own fireside, lying out their personal gardens, building furniture's and building garages. Some really enthusiastic enthusiasts go so far as to make their personal record players and radio transmitters. Shop cater of the do it yourself trend not only by running particular advisory services for notices, but by contribution consumers bits and pieces which they can assemble at home. Such things supply an excellent outlet for pent up creative power, but sadly not all of us are born handymen. Wives are likely to believe that their husbands are considerably ingenious and flexible. Even husbands who can barely drive a nail in straight are thought to be born electricians, plumbers, carpenters and mechanics. When light fuse, furniture gets wobbly, pipes get blocked, or vacuum cleaners fall to work wives automatically presume that their husbands will in some way put things right. The nastiest thing about the do it yourself sport is that sometimes husband live under the intensity that they can do everything even when they have been over and over again proved incorrect. It is a question of arrogance as much as everything else. Last spring my wife recommended that I call in a man to look at our home turf mower. It had broken down the earlier summer and though I promised to mend it, I had got by no means round to it. I would hear of the offer and said I would have fixed it for myself. On Saturday afternoon I hauled the equipments into the backyard and had a close look at it. As far as I can see, it only required a minor alteration, a turn of a screw here a slight tightening up there, a drop of oil and it would be as fine as new.

One of the major advances in recent skill has been the creation of computers. They are already extensively used in business and in universities. Now there is barely any sphere of human life where computers have not been used for the service of Man. We are heading quick on the close of this current century towards a circumstance when a computer will be as much part of man's everyday life as a telephone or a fridge. Computers are skilled of doing tremendously difficult work in all branches of knowledge. They can resolve the most difficult mathematical troubles or put thousands of unconnected facts in order. These machines can be put to various uses. For example they can give information on the best way to avoid travel accidents or they can add up the number of times the word and has been utilized in the Bible, since they work precisely and at high speeds, they keep research staff years of hard work. The entire process by which appliance can be used to work for us had been called mechanization. In the upcoming automation may allow human beings far more spare time than they do nowadays. The coming of mechanization is bound to have significant social cost. Some years ago a specialist on mechanization, Sir Leon Bagrit, pointed out that it was a fault to consider that this machine could feel. There is chance that human being will be forbidden by equipments, though computers are capable of erudition from their fault to consider that these equipments could consider. There is no likelihood that human will be restricted by equipments. Though computers are proficient of education from their mistakes and humanizing on the presentation, they require complete instructions from human beings to be able to function. There can by no means, as it was to lead autonomous lives or rule the globe by making choices of their own.

Sir, Leon said that in the expectations, computers would be developed which would be minute enough to take in the pocket. Common people would then be able to utilize them to get hold of precious information. Computers could be plugged into a nationwide network and be used like radios. For example, people going on celebration could be informed about weather conditions conditions, car drivers can be given options routes when there are traffic. It will also be probable to make small translating equipments. This will allow people who do not contribute to a common speech to talk to each other without any complexity or to read foreign book. It is impossible to way in the importance of an appliance of this sort, for much worldwide confusion is caused only through our malfunction to recognize each other. Computers will also be used in normal community hospitals. By given that an appliance with patients systems, a doctor will be able to analyze the nature of his sickness. In the same way, machines could be utilized to make sure on a patient's physical condition evidence and bring it up to appointment. Doctors will therefore have an instant way in to a great many facts which will assist them to their job. Book keepers and accountants too could be done completely by equipments. Computers will also be able to tell the precise period a man is going to survive with the assist of his blood picture. Computers are the well-organized servants man has ever had and there is no boundary to the way they can be utilized to recover our lives.

To the greater or less degree all the civilized communities of the modern world are made up of a small class of rulers, corrupted by too much power and of a large class of subjects corrupted by too much passive and irresponsible obedience. Participation in a social order of this kind makes it very difficult for any individual to achieve that non attachment in the midst of the activity, which is the distinguishing mark of the ideally excellent human being and where there is not at least a considerable degree of non attachment activity, the ideal society of the prophets cannot be realized. A desirable social order is the one that delivers us from avoidable evils. A bad social order is one that leads us into temptation which, if matters were more sensibly arranged, would never rise. Our present business is to discover what large scale changes are best calculated to deliver us from the evils of too much power and of too much passive and irresponsible obedience.

In the modern world the great obstacle to all desirable change is war. The cardinal, the indispensible reform therefore is a reform in the present policy of national communities in regard to one another. Today all nations conduct their foreign policy on militaristic principles. Some are more explicitly, more vulgarly and nosily than others but all, even those that call themselves democratic and pacific, consistently act upon the principles of militarism.

Then they came just when we required them. If you are going by a train, it is always superior to be contentedly early than even a fraction of a minute behind. Although being early can mean slaying a little time, this will be less than if you fail to spot the train and have to wait for an hour or so for the next one.

Tornadoes are one of the huge and ruthless types of typical weather occurrence. Tornadoes, aggressively revolve columns of air, happen when there is a change in wind route, coupled with a raise in wind velocity, results in a rotating effect in the lower ambiance. There are many people fear tornadoes and their critical power, few people do not appreciate their real causes and belongings, nor are they conscious of how to defend themselves from their overwhelming force. As the spinning cloud depicts in the humid air that sets it at land level, its spinning motion start on to go quicker, thus making a funnel that expand from the cloud on top of it to the ground beneath. The rotating movements, which might not be noticeable to the bare eye, are exacerbating when the revolving air piece shifts from a parallel to a perpendicular position. In this way, tornadoes become pendent from low force rainstorm clouds.

Roaming all over the landscape, the tornados inflict a pathway of concentrated demolition. When a tornado gets in touch with the ground, it makes a brawny increasing draft recognized as a vortex, a strengthening feature of wind that can attain speeds in overindulgence of 300 miles per hour. Houses that give way to the power of the tornado appear to blow up as the low air force within the vortex collides with the usual air force inside the building. It is not rare for these twisters to lift weighty objects, like motorbikes or huge animal's, and throw them quite a lot of miles far. Evenly, tornadoes can occur at any time throughout the day, but frequently happen between 2:00 in the afternoon and 10:00 in the evening. Tornadoes can happen at any season of the year, but are classically most common during the summer seasons. On regular basis, there are 1,500 tornadoes per year in this huge nation, causing 80 wounded and 1,700 wound. While these violent funnels happen in numerous parts of the world, they are most widespread in the United States.

One of the major advances in recent skill has been the creation of computers. They are already extensively used in business and in universities. Now there is barely any sphere of human life where computers have not been used for the service of Man. We are heading quick on the close of this current century towards a circumstance when a computer will be as much part of man's everyday life as a telephone or a fridge. Computers are skilled of doing tremendously difficult work in all branches of knowledge. They can resolve the most difficult mathematical troubles or put thousands of unconnected facts in order. These machines can be put to various uses. For example they can give information on the best way to avoid travel accidents or they can add up the number of times the word and has been utilized in the Bible, since they work precisely and at high speeds, they keep research staff years of hard work. The entire process by which appliance can be used to work for us had been called mechanization. In the upcoming automation may allow human beings far more spare time than they do nowadays. The coming of mechanization is bound to have significant social cost. Some years ago a specialist on mechanization, Sir Leon Bagrit, pointed out that it was a fault to consider that this machine could feel. There is chance that human being will be forbidden by equipments, though computers are capable of erudition from their fault to consider that these equipments could consider. There is no likelihood that human will be restricted by equipments. Though computers are proficient of education from their mistakes and humanizing on the presentation, they require complete instructions from human beings to be able to function. There can by no means, as it was to lead autonomous lives or rule the globe by making choices of their own.

Sir, Leon said that in the expectations, computers would be developed which would be minute enough to take in the pocket. Common people would then be able to utilize them to get hold of precious information. Computers could be plugged into a nationwide network and be used like radios. For example, people going on celebration could be informed about weather conditions conditions, car drivers can be given options routes when there are traffic. It will also be probable to make small translating equipments. This will allow people who do not contribute to a common speech to talk to each other without any complexity or to read foreign book. It is impossible to way in the importance of an appliance of this sort, for much worldwide confusion is caused only through our malfunction to recognize each other. Computers will also be used in normal community hospitals. By given that an appliance with patients systems, a doctor will be able to analyze the nature of his sickness. In the same way, machines could be utilized to make sure on a patient's physical condition evidence and bring it up to appointment. Doctors will therefore have an instant way in to a great many facts which will assist them to their job. Book keepers and accountants too could be done completely by equipments. Computers will also be able to tell the precise period a man is going to survive with the assist of his blood picture. Computers are the well-organized servants man has ever had and there is no boundary to the way they can be utilized to recover our lives.

Newspapers not only give us knowledge about the old activities which may increase the awareness among the human beings and may not claim the logical involvement in that problem, but also something more than that. In fact with passage of time newspapers have grown into not only a diversion for the breakfast table but also an essential source of knowledge and the most important medium of making the people democratic in their outlook and thinking. At the earlier stages of its growth the press was just to give knowledge to the people and keep them busy to the changes in the country and the world at large. But as all medium of learning are used or misused for one or the other reason so is the case with the news papers. Many years ago Burke called the media the fourth estate and we can expediently call it the fourth significant organ of the self-governing states and others being managerial, magistrates, and government. If the press is self-governing and the reports are intent, which is of course not possible, it can keep the minds of the people open to all imitation. But now days there are subtle suggestion in the news and there is very clever distortion here and there. So, now-a-days, the primary purpose of newspapers is to color the opinion of the people. They provide the public with readymade opinions and baked ideas. The people also accept these things happily because the common man has neither the intelligence nor the time to verify the validity of the news or gather the correct opinion from other sources. Otherwise also it is the weakness of even educated people that they believe a printed word more readily than a word from mouth. Therefore, most of the people quote newspapers in order to support their contentions. Once the ideas are propagated, it is very difficult, because of the lack of resources, to sift the truth from falsehood. Consequently, people become the victim of propaganda without being conscious of this process. A free press can definitely consolidate the forces of democracy and can easily negate the influence of pulls and pressures which have been dragging the citizens away from the democratic thinking. If the news is reported objectively and the problems are analyzed with no bias, it is definitely possible to make the people think correctly.

Each woman, whether she opts for to admit it or not, has an inborn longing to be desired. Even the staunchest of feminists wishes to be received by other women. It goes without saying that we, as we individuals, don't take pleasure in being not liked and we go to any extent to make ourselves more willingly up to standard for others. There's nothing immoral with being futile, as long as we don't get passed away with it. We only want to look beautiful and best. And people have been really trying hard to look stunning and beautiful from many centuries. For women, one of the simplest ways to get better self-confidence and self-image is one and only makeup. Are we in fact in a vain civilization? Do we actually have a more-than usual pleasure in our look? To answer that, you'd have to describe regular. And that's why makeup has such a long past. We'd like to tell you little about the history of makeup and cosmetics here. The Egyptians people were regarded as very stylish people in the world. The Egyptians were also extremely creative people. They had a skill for developing fresh formulas to resolve their skin problems. It may sound weird but it's been said that around the sixteenth to the ninth centuries BC, they had beauty products that would help them to get rid of blemishes, stretch marks, dark circles, wrinkles, scars, and also helped them to grow hairs. There are many things which they came up with were very modern, even compared to today's standards. And cosmetics were one of the important things in those days and played a very important role. Egyptians applied were eye makeup, body oils and face creams, as well as a broad collection of body sprays and fragrances. Egyptians people used blistered almonds, tarnished copper, a pair of various colored copper rust, ash, lead, and ochre. They are also known as kohl, and it looks like a dark shade powder, which was used with a little stick, above and below the eyes. That's astonishing, when you glance at the line of cosmetics products that will do those similar jobs which we find today. And today, we give the impression to require all kinds of study and improvement programs to come up with the similar thing. Possibly there's something to be said for fresh and natural beauty cosmetics after all. They also took great care of their nails. They applied henna to color them in yellow or orange. Quite a multicolored picture, isn't it? But that's precisely what they required back then something similar to today's makeup. They gave their eyes an almond shape. Then, to make their eyes more beautiful they applied the good and fancy eye makeup, they used an assortment of water and red clay to their cheeks and lips.

And the Egyptians weren't good at just putting together natural products. Some research done by the famous cosmetic brand L'Oreal, along with researcher from the Louvre in Paris, exposed that the black eye makeup applied back then had components that had to have been not naturally made, because a natural derivation couldn't be created. The study also proved that mesdemet got its creamy softness from its 10-15% oil content. That's just the similar as many of the eye beauty cosmetics products on the market which is found today. Do you think we are really modern, or just existing in the past? Way back, cosmetics products were used to improve the prettiness of the female face. And by the way, men applied them, too. Back then, all Egyptians took showered both in the river and from a basin which were found at home. They applied beauty cosmetic cleansers made from fresh vegetable or sometimes from animal fat assorted with lime powdered and fragrance - almost certainly not much dissimilar from some of the soaps bars which we apply today. Also, the atmosphere was very scorching and dry in those earlier days and the people required something special to keep their skin supple and soft. So they applied fragrant oils to guard themselves from the hot and humid type of weather. As the years passed, through assaults and relocations, cultures combined, and that had a deep outcome on the worth of cosmetics products. Keep in mind, the Egyptians held a sturdy link between their cosmetic product and their religion. However, when the much more open-minded Greeks moved in, ideas about cosmetics products changed. The real use of beauty products didn't decline at all, but their association with religion did. The Greeks applied  beauty products was chiefly very good, cosmetic product. They were still fascinated in looking beautiful.

Some opinionated thinkers believe that freedom and equality cannot go together. They think that liberty implies the freedom to do what one would wish to do. This is true if freedom is deduced in its total sense to mean that each human being shall be free of charge according to his prospect, there will be disorder. It is a session of history that at whatever time people are permissible to do as they wish the clever and more proficient used their freedom to ponder all wealth and authority in themselves to the unhappiness and domination of the rest. Visibly the off-putting view is described by those who fit in to advantaged section of society and for this reason search for the preserve class quota for the sake of their vested benefit. They believe that parity is unachievable in conditions of such unobstructed freedom. Lord action therefore says, "The obsession of impartiality made vain the anticipation of freedom." The exponents of this view held that liberty is natural, equality is not. Nature itself created differences. For example some are intellectuals, others are not. Liberty means freedom that is no restriction, equality needs some restrictions. This is against the principle of liberty. The institution of property is a natural institution and therefore should not be restricted by equality. Perfect quality is only possible when enforced by state. This means the power of state will increase. Excess power of the state is harmful to the liberty of the people. Moreover state has produced many evils of capitalism. It has encouraged exploitation. It has given protection to the capitalist. Such a state cannot give a perfect quality. So the hope of liberty also vanished away. The democracy is said to be a system based on equality and Liberty. But unfortunately the democracy is becoming elites, democracy or dollar democracy. Either this is controlled by educated class or by the capitalist. Presence of elite or capitalist is inequality. Hence equality and liberty appear opposed to each other. The Liberals as well as Marxists have asserted that liberty and equality are not opposed to each other. Liberty has no meaning if it is not enjoyed by all. All may enjoy liberty only when privileged classes are abolished in the society. In a society of unequal freedom becomes a farce. What is the use of the expression of thoughts, when some are deprived?

A sound public view cannot be created. That is why R.H. Tawney observes that a large measure of impartiality as far from being unfavorable to liberty is necessary to it. If there is just liberty, there will be disorder. The liberty will be oppressed for individual profits. Dunham writes, a grouping of men whose public role consists of taking proceeds from other people's work can have no deep belief in equality and organization as preferred ideals. Thus freedom desires equality so that there is no consideration of assets in one or few hands. The Marxists have gone to the amount of saying that freedom and equality are closely related for an open society. The liberals think that equality can never be victorious till there is ideal liberty with impartiality. Laski a champion of open-mindedness writers, there cannot in a word be self-governing government without equality and without self-ruled government there cannot get freedom. Democracy is based on following equality. Political equality is not probable without social and financial equality. In the deficiency of economic equality, some social class will control politics and in the absence of economic equality liberty is just a myth. People may enjoy real liberty only where social and economic quality is established, this will make democracy successful.

Thus we find that liberty without quality is pointless. We may take pleasure in liberty only when there is wonderful equality. If liberty is to be viewed as optimistic thing then impartiality is pre-requisite. The Marxist clearly affirmed there is dissimilarity in the society due to the organization of personal property. Many modern liberal writers articulated the relation between belongings and equality but Marxists systematically examined the question of impartiality in relation to belongings. They maintained  an egalitarian society one will work according to one's capability and each will get according to one's requirement. The Marxists maintain that opinionated and social equality is a fairy tale without financial equality. In the deficiency of financial equality those holding the means of invention will control politics. They decline that the state can make impartiality in a class separated society through wellbeing measures. They consider that social possession of the means of construction in a given civilization is a pre conditioned for economic equality. The Marxists believe that all difference cannot be removed. They sat communist equality presupposes the abolition not of all dissimilarity and such conditions as would go up to a dissimilarity in the social location of people.

The determined plan of the petroleum bureau to introduce lead complimentary petrol is not likely to take off. The utilization of old model vehicles by a large section of the people and the high cost involved in making the necessary changes  in the engine for switching over to use of lead free petrol are the major hurdles in the smooth take off of the plan. Faced with rising level of greenhouse gasses, mainly in the urban cities, the ministry of petroleum has issued training as early as in 1986 to bring down the utmost permissible lead content in petrol from 0.26 grams per liter to 0.36 grams per liter by September 1995, this training were continual on October 20th, 1995 and the revised target dates were separated into two parts. Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai were to bring in petrol with lead content of 0.26 gram per liter by November 1998, with the rest of the country being abounding with petrol not more than 0.15 gram per liter by the similar period. Sources in the petroleum Ministry pointed out that the introduction of lead free petrol need heavy asset. While preferably a vehicle should be run on lead less petrol, the automobile industry in the country is not fully equipped to manufacture such automobile which can run on lead free petrol. Sources pointed out that the lead less petrol can only be used on a catalatic convertor made of to be changed so that at the time of the manufacturing itself such convertors can be fitted. Significantly the cost of imported catatic convertors is in the range of Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 35,000.

Vijaya Murthy has done it and this time it is with a big knock! She has hit the banner with an award from the national commission for learning Research and Training (N.C.E.R.T) for her pioneering method to get the individuality of teachers better. It all started in the year 1981, when Vijaya took over as director for the S.I.E.S organization of Pre-primary Education. She observes that in spite of scoring fine in theory, most of the trainer teachers were nowhere when it came to classroom education. She remembers how she spoke to them in class. You will be training two to ten year olds. Their concentration span is very little. To keep their curiosity in the topic or the subject active, you must let your language act aloud. Be lively in class, have fun and dance with the other kids. On the other hand much to her chagrin, many of them did not pay attention to her. There was this lady singing "Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are,  up above the world so high", her hands barely went over her ears. Another teacher was so timid that she perspired copiously in class. Rajeshwari was in tears at her own dilemma. Lakshami had no endurance and Maria was almost deaf and dumb. These women were genuine and motivated, but they required help in an area that was further than the scope of the pre-primary tutor, training program in spite of being an important part of it. Vijaya comprehended that a huge popularity of her students were middle-class ladies. She says, they are trained from early on childhood to act like ladies. Such limitations inhibit the development of their personality. They become timid, withdrawn and drop self-confidence in them. Having pin-pointed the root reason of the students problems, Vijaya soon urbanized a set of 25 innovative, 19 workshop designed to assist them. As the students take part in arguments, singing, dancing, drama, and other activities they relate and their character begin to unfold. The teachers to study more about the student and after ending of the course the person emerge as better human beings. Lakshmi, now as an employees member says, I used to drop my anger while coaching and used to yell at my own children. After the workshop and compassion I have become responsive to the requirements of the children and have developed more liberal. Dharma who thought wariness was part of her nature, can now speak to unfamiliar person without indecision. Rajeswari has grown-up now sensitively. She had some psychological problems and frequently used to break down in tears.

Now she is certain enough to run her own day nursery school. Much before the N.CE.R.T marked her, Vijaya had conventional recognition in the learning world. She is the member of the St. Xavier's association of Education and Comprehensive College of education. She frequently is been called by the school to design and pass on refresher courses for in-service agenda for teachers. Ambitious schools demand her to conduct workshops for bring in new original techniques in teaching children. Close to Vijaya's heart are the troubles of ladies. The age bar of unification the course was 35.                                                                                                                                                                

As soon as she took over, she did away with this. Knowledgeable middle class women begin to live at 45. By this time their children are developed and pressures are negligent. To keep the doors of learning institutions blocked to them is to reject them the right to teach themselves, she muses. Though fully enfolded in her career, she does deal with to take time off for public work as president of Stree Chetna, a woman association in Chembur. They carry out different activities connected to the uplift of female. Vijaya herself makes up psychoanalysis session for harassed and depressed women. Stree Chetna as the very name connotes plans at development of woman. Women of the association make sure that they engross their sons also in housework's and give their daughters equivalent chance for teaching and job building. Vijaya's father was deputy teaching officers in the BMC and her mother an expert social worker. Visibly her education was taken very good care. An M.A. in child growth with a diploma in primary teacher's teaching; she has a cord of other qualification that she has scored high in PhD. Yet, she authentically feels it would have been impractical for her to attain anything without her husband's encouragement, though she is not free of the normal fault that working mothers wharf. An expert woman deeply concerned in her career is unusual. Any other working women can pay for to sort out her work and home. When asked about her potential plans, she says she will carry on with her research and at the same time put into practice her techniques in the field of teaching.

    What is the drive of Vijaya's innovative workshop?

Freedom is man's fundamental right, one of his basic necessities for a full life. Death is preferable to slavery. But political freedom alone would not do. Tagore exhorted the people to be free from so many other evils. The evils of blind beliefs, sluggishness, old habits, falsehood and dependence on fate. They should be the masters of their own destiny. This poem gives us Tagore's new concept of freedom. It is not limited to political freedom. He foresees a bright future for Bharat. He draws attention to several pitfalls and evils other than independence from slavery. To start with, Tagore calls for freedom from fear, the fear of pain and suffering in the course of freedom struggle. The country men of free India should also shake of the burden of blind beliefs, slackness, old dead habits, fatalism and falsehood. These social evils are crippling the country and blinding the people to the call for action and progress. The poet wishes his countrymen to wake up from the centuries or sleep of slavery. They should be up and doing. They should break the old chains and feel free to follow the path of wisdom and truth. The path of truth is beset with dangers. Only men with bold adventurous spirit can walk on it.

Tagore wants the people to be forward looking and self confident. They must not submit to their fate timidly. They should be masters and makers of their own destiny. They have been victims of unkind fate for ages. Their ship was thrown to the mercy of uncertain winds. It had been guided by a powerful hand which had no sympathy with the masses. India, feels Tagore is being treated like a puppet. Her movements are controlled by some invisible hands. The puppet like people dance to their tune as a matter of habits. These wooden figures become active is a momentary copying of life. The fact is that they are lifeless and mindless figures.

The history of India is one of the majestic epics of world record and can be finely described in the expressions of India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru as "a collection of disagreements held together by sturdy but invisible threads".

In the early  17th century, children of Genghis Khan swept transversely the Khyber Pass and recognized the Mughal Empire, which stayed for 250 years. From the 12th to the 16th centuries, southern India was conquered by Hindu Chola and Vijayanagar Empires. During this time, the two systems, the current Hindu and Muslim mixed, leaving eternal civilizing influences on each other. Known to be the land of epics and mythology, two of the world's supreme heroic find their nativity in Indian surroundings - the Ramayana, portraying the make use of  God Ram, and the Mahabharata detailing the conflict among the Kauravas and the Pandavas, both children of King Bharat. Ramayana traces God Ram's trip from banish to  free his wife Sita from the demonic rule of Ravana with the help of his simian escorts. Singing the qualities of Dharma, the Holy book Gita, is one of the most valuable scriptures in Indian tradition, is the opinion given by Shri Krishna to the angst laden Arjun, who is frightened at the reflection of killing his kin, on the fight ground. Mahatma Gandhi invigorated these qualities, again, painted new verve in them, during India's sovereignty fight against British Colonialism.

The beginning of ice cream can be traced back to at least the 5th century B.C. In the early hours references comprise the Roman ruler Nero (A.D. 38-69) who ordered ice to be brought from the hills and mixed with fruit juice and toppings, and King Tang (A.D. 619-99) of Shang, China who had a technique of making ice and milk mixture. Ice cream was probably brought from China back to Europe. Over a point of time, procedures for ices, fruit juices, and milk ices developed and presented in the stylish Italian and French majestic courts. The first ice creams were a right splendid delicacy, and ice cream sustained to be a costly treat until American dairy man named Jacob Fussell set up the first and tasty ice-cream plant, in the year 1855. Since then the beginning of wafers, cones, and solid chocolate-ices have made ice cream ever more well-liked.

The first ice-covered desserts were made-up by the Arabs and Chinese over 3000 years ago. The Khalifs of the country Baghdad were trailblazers who drank cool fruit syrups along with snow. This scrumptious drink was initially called "sharbet" or it was also called as fruit ice, in Arabic. Alexander the Great and the Roman ruler Nero ate fruit flavored syrup mixed with snow or ice, but these were ancestors of sorbet to a certain extent than ice cream, and most likely the first people to take pleasure in dairy ice cream were English.  In England during the 17th century, it's been said that King James II in 1688, was presented with something like ice-cream, while his banished brother, Charles II, previously in 1665, was known to have consumed ice-cream in Paris. Around twenty five years later on, in 1875, an ice-cream industrial unit was set up in London for the profit of a large number of Italians migrant who came at that time. Ice-cream is said to have become truly well-liked in the year 1925, when British Thomas Wall, a sausage producer in Acton, was concerned that few sausages will be sold during the summer seasons, so he began to produce the first covered blocks of ice-cream as a substitute.  It was an immediate achievement. In the United States, the first president, known as George Washington, was said to be enthusiastic on ice-cream in the year 1795.In 1835, Augustus Jackson, a manufacturer from Philadelphia, formed new recipes for producing ice-cream, and in the year 1845, Nancy Johnson untested a hand cranked refrigerator that recognized the essential method of producing ice cream which is still used today. William Young untested the alike "Johnson Patent Ice-Cream refrigerator" in the year 1850. In the year 1855, Jacob Fussell, a milk dealer of Baltimore, USA, set himself up as a dealer of ice-cream to new milkman, creating the world's first ice-cream industrial unit. Now days we find Ice-cream is endlessly made, with all kinds of flavors mixed with different seasonal fruits, artificial flavors and cream.
