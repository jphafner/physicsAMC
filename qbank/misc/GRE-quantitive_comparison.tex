        Mike reached first
        No relation 

    Ans : C

    Explanation:
    Tom is driving at the speed of 25 miles per hour so he reaches in 4 hours, while Mike is driving at a speed of 40 miles per hour, so he reaches in 2.5 hours, hence (c) is the right answer.

    Quantity A: (5/12)4
    Quantity B: (5/12)1/2

        Quantity 1 is greater than quantity 2
        Quantity 2 is greater than quantity 1
        Both the quantities are equal
        There is no relationship between the two quantities 

    Ans : A

    Explanation:
    (5/12)4 = 0.0301; (5/12)1/2 = 0.2083
    Therefore quantity 2 is greater than quantity 1

    Quantity A: 5/125
    Quantity B: 0.35/7

        Quantity 1 is greater than quantity 2
        Quantity 2 is greater than quantity 1
        There is no relation between both the quantities
        Both quantities are equal 

    Ans : B

    Explanation:
    5/125 = 0.04; 0.35/7 = 0.05
    Therefore (b) is the answer

    Column a = 3b + 6
    Column b = 3
    Assume that quantity 1 is (a) and quantity 2 is 15. Determine whether

        Quantity 1 is greater than 2
        Quantity 2 is greater than 1
        Both quantities are equal
        The relationship between the two quantities cannot be determined 

    Ans : C

    Explanation:
    As quantity 1 = a = 3b + 6
    = 3 (3) + 6
    = 9 + 6
    = 15 = quantity 2.
    Therefore the answer is (c)

    C + 3D >10
    Quantity A: 3C + 6D
    Quantity B: 24

        Quantity 2 is greater than quantity 1
        Both the quantities are equal
        Quantity 1 is greater than quantity 2
        The relationship between the two quantities cannot be determined 

    Ans : D

    Explanation:
    C + 3D > 10
    Hence, C > 10 - 3D
    Multiplying by 3 to both sides of inequality,
    3C > 30-9D
    Hence, 3C + 9D > 30
    Now Q1: 3C + 6D
    Q2: 24
    Hence, there is no relation between these two.
    Option (d) is the answer

    X = the number of hours in 5 days
    Y = the number of seconds in 2 minutes

        Y is greater than X
        X is greater than Y
        There is no relation between X and Y
        X = Y 

    Ans : D

    Explanation:
    X = 5 x 24 =120
    Y = 2 x 60 = 120
    Therefore X = Y.

    A = 6-3/28
    B = 7/8 + 2/64

        B is greater than A
        A is greater than B
        There is no relationship between A and B
        A is equal to B 

    Ans : B

    Explanation:
    A = 6-3/28 = 3/28 = 0.1071
    B = 7/8 + 2/64 = 0.875 + 0.0312 = 0.9062
    Therefore A is greater than B

    R = 2/x + 2/y = 2/6
    S = 2/x2 + 2/y2 = 7/9

        R and S are equal
        R > S
        R < S
        Relation not defined 

    Ans : D

    Explanation:
    S = 2/x 2 + 2/y 2 = 7/9 = 1/x 2 + 1/y 2 = 7/18
    R = 2/x + 2/y = 2/6 = 1/x + 1/y = 1/6
    R 2 = 1/x 2 + 2/xy + 1/y 2 = 1/36
    R 2 = 1/x 2 + 1/y 2 =1/36 - 2/xy
    Therefore the relation between R and S is not defined.

    X = 0.36
    Y = 0.42 / 3

        X is greater than Y
        Y is greater than X
        X is equal to Y
        There is no relation between X and Y 

    Ans : A

    Explanation:
    Y = 0.42 / 3 = 0.14, whereas X = 0.36.
    Therefore X is greater than Y.

    The circumference of a circle is equal to the perimeter of a square. Quantity 1: the area of the square Quantity 2: the area of a circle

        Quantity 2 is greater than quantity 1
        Both the quantities are equal
        Quantity 1 is greater than quantity 2
        Relation cannot be defined 

    Ans : C

    Explanation:

    Explanation:
    In case of a circle, the circumference (C) = 2pr and the area (A) = pr2; where r is the radius
    In case of a square, the perimeter (P) is 4s and the area (As) is s2; where s is the side
    Let the r = 1; C = 2π(1) = 2π and A = πr2 = π(1)2 = π = 3.14
    P = C; 4s = 2π = 6.28; s = 6.28/4 = 1.57 and As = s2 = (1.57)2 = 2.46
    Therefore, the area of circle is greater than the area of square.

    Every student in the John’s class is either 10, 11 or 12 years old. One third of the class students are 12, while twice as many school students are 12 as 11.
    Quantity 1: number of 10 year old school students
    Quantity 2: number of 12 and 11 year old school students

        Quantity 2 is greater than quantity 1
        Both quantities are equal
        Quantity 1 is greater than quantity 2
        Relation cannot be determined 

    Ans : D

    Explanation:
    Let x = 1
    C = {(1 + 5)/6} – {(1 + 1)/9} = 1-(2/9) = (9 – 2)/9 = 7/9
    D = (1 + 2)/4 = 3/4
    Therefore C is not equal to D

    Q = (x-2)(x)(x+2)
    R = (x)(x)(x)(x)

        Q is equal than R
        Q is greater than R
        There is no relation between Q and R
        R is greater than Q 

    Ans : C

    Explanation:
    Let x = 1
    Q = (1 – 2)(1)(1 + 2) = (-1)(1)(3) = -3
    R = (1)(1)(1)(1) = 1
    Therefore (c) is the right answer

    Y= (2 * 4 * 10)/(1600)1/2
    X = (4 * 5 * 16)/(32 * 50) 1/2

        Y is greater than X
        Y is equal to X
        X is greater than Y
        No relationship between X and Y 

    Ans : B

    Explanation:
    Y = (2 * 4 * 10)/(1600) 1/2 = 80/32 = 2.5
    X = (4 * 5 * 16)/(32 x 50) 1/2 = 320/32 = 2.5
    Therefore the answer is (b)

    In a right angled triangle ABC,
    1 = AB = BC
    2 = AC

        1 is equal to 2
        2 is greater than 1
        1 is greater than 2
        There is no relation between 1 and 2 

    Ans : B

    Explanation:
    As this is a right angled equilateral triangle, we apply the Pythagoras theorem.
    Let AB = a, BC = b and AC = c
    According to the Pythagoras theorem, a2 + b2 = c2
    As the square of the third side is the sum of the squares of the other two sides, option
    (b) is the right answer.

    A= (7x – 4)/3 = x + 4
    B = (5x – 3)/2 = x + 3

        A is equal to B
        B is greater than A
        B is smaller than A
        Relation not defined 

    Ans : D

    Explanation:
    For A: 7x-4 = 3x+12
    4x = 16
    x = 4
    For B: 5x-3 = 2x+6
    3x = 9
    x = 3
    Hence no relation

    A = x2 + y2 = 36
    B = xy = 15

        There is no relation between A and B
        A is equal to B
        A is greater than B
        B is greater than A 

    Ans : A

    Explanation:
    For A: x2 +y2 = 36
    For B: xy = 15
    Squaring both sides
    x2y2 = 225
    Hence no relation

    Alex builds a 4 feet wall in 8 days, while Frank builds a 122 cm wall in 4 days. Determine whether

        Alex built the wall faster than Frank
        Frank built the wall faster than Alex
        Alex and Frank finished building the wall at the same time
        There is no relation between the Alex and Frank’s wall 

    Ans : B

    Explanation:
    122 cm = 4 feet and Frank built the wall in 4 days,
    while Alex took 8 days, therefore option
    (b) is the right answer.

    A = the number of months in 8 years
    B = the number of days in 14 weeks

        A is greater than B
        A is equal to B
        B is greater than A
        There is no relation between A and B 

    Ans : C

    Explanation:
    A = 12 * 8 = 96
    B = 7 * 14 = 98
    Therefore B is greater than A

Given below are two different quantities. The student has to find the relation between these.

    Quantity 1: the perimeter of a rectangle whose area is 28 and length is 7
    Quantity 2: the perimeter of a rectangle whose area is 30 and length is 6
        Quantity 2 is greater than quantity 1
        Quantity 1 is greater than quantity 2
        The relationship between the two quantities cannot be determined
        Both the quantities are equal 

    Ans : A

    Explanation:
    Perimeter of a rectangle = sum of all the sides of the rectangle
    Area of a rectangle = l * b
    In case of quantity 1: area = 28 = 7 * 4 (where 7 is length and 4 is breadth)
    Therefore, perimeter = 7 + 4 + 7 + 4 = 22
    In case of quantity 2: area = 30 = 6 * 5 (where 6 is length and 5 is breadth)
    Therefore, perimeter = 6 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 22
    Therefore both the quantities are equal.

    The circumference of a circle is equal to the perimeter of a square.
    Quantity 1: the area of the square
    Quantity 2: the area of a circle
        Quantity 2 is greater than quantity 1
        Both the quantities are equal
        Quantity 1 is greater than quantity 2
        Relation cannot be defined 

    Ans : C

    Explanation:
    In case of a circle, the circumference (C) = 2πr and the area (A) = πr2; where r is the radius
    In case of a square, the perimeter (P) is 4s and the area (As) is s2; where s is the side
    Let the r = 1; C = 2π (1) = 2π and A = πr2 = π (1) 2 = π = 3.14
    P = C; 4s = 2π = 6.28; s = 6.28/4 = 1.57 and As = s2 = (1.57) 2 = 2.46
    Therefore, the area of circle is greater than the area of square.

    Every student in the John’s class is either 10, 11 or 12 years old. One third of the class students are 12, while twice as many school students are 12 as 11.
    Quantity 1: number of 10 year old school students
    Quantity 2: number of 12 and 11 year old school students
        Quantity 2 is greater than quantity 1
        Both quantities are equal
        Quantity 1 is greater than quantity 2
        Relation cannot be determined 

    Ans : B

    Explanation:
    Consider that there are around 12 students in the class.
    Number of 12 year old students = (12) * 1/3 = 4
    Number of 11 year old students = (number of 16 year old students / 2)
    = 4 / 2 = 2
    Therefore, quantity 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
    The remaining are 10 year old students, which is 12 – 6 = 6
    Therefore, quantity 2 = quantity 1

    Quantity 1: 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/6
    Quantity 2: 1/2 + 1/5 + 1/6
        Both the quantities are equal
        No relation between the two quantities
        Quantity 1 is greater than quantity 2
        Quantity 2 is greater than quantity 1 

    Ans : C

    Explanation:
    Subtract 1/2 and 1/6 from both the columns
    Therefore, 1/4 > 1/5, which means than quantity 1 is greater than quantity 2

    The sides of a triangle are 3, 5 and x
    Quantity 1: 8
    Quantity 2: x
        Quantity 2 is greater than quantity 1
        Quantity 1 is greater than quantity 2
        Relation cannot be determined using the given explanation
        Quantity 1 is equal to quantity 2 

    Ans : B

    Explanation:
    Here we use the principle of triangle inequality which is defined as "the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle always exceeds the length of the third side".

    There are 10 cooks in kitchen A and 20 cooks in kitchen B. Each kitchen has more number of male cooks than female cooks.
    Quantity 1: number of male cooks in kitchen A
    Quantity 2: number of male cooks in kitchen B
        Quantity 2 is greater than quantity 1
        Quantity 1 is greater than quantity 2
        Relation cannot be determined
        Both quantities are equal 

    Ans : A

    Explanation:
    More than half, (i.e., more than 10) of kitchen B’s 20 cooks are male. But, kitchen A has only 10 cooks therefore (a) is the right answer

    d is a negative number
    Quantity 1: - d2
    Quantity 2: d2
        Quantity 1 is greater than quantity 2
        Quantity 2 is greater than quantity 1
        Quantity 1 is equal to quantity 2
        No relation 

    Ans : B

    Explanation:
    Adding d2 to both the quantities,
    In case of quantity 1: -d2 + d2 = - 2d2
    In case of quantity 2: d2 + d2 = 2d2
    As d is negative, 2d2 is positive. Therefore (b) is the right option.

    Quantity 1: 25/(25) 1/2
    Quantity 2: 10/(4) 1/2
        Quantity 1 is equal to quantity 2
        Quantity 1 is greater than quantity 2
        Quantity 2 is greater than quantity 1
        No relation 

    Ans : A

    Explanation:
    Squaring both the quantities
    In case of quantity 1: (25) 2/{(25) 1/2)2 = 625/25 = 25
    In case of quantity 2: (10) 2/{(10) 1/2} 2 = 100/4 = 25
    Therefore, option (a) is the right answer

    Quantity 1: a + 7
    Quantity 1: a – 7
        Quantity 1 is greater than quantity 2
        Quantity 1 is equal to quantity 2
        Quantity 2 is greater than quantity 1
        No relation 

    Ans : A

    Explanation:
    Let case 1 = positive number; case 2 = 0; case 3 = negative number.
    In all the three cases, we find that quantity 1 is greater than quantity 2.
    Clearly, 7 > -7; and when we add (a) to side, it comes to a + 7 > a - 7

    q = (2/3)x, r = (5/6)x, s = (3/5)r
    Quantity 1 = 4s
    Quantity 2 = 3q
        Quantity 2 is greater than quantity 1
        Quantity 1 is greater than quantity 2
        No relation between the two quantities
        Both the quantities are equal 

    Ans : D

    Explanation:
    Let x = 0. Therefore q, r, and s will be equal to 0.
    Therefore, in this case both the quantities are equal.
    Now, let x = 12, therefore q = (2/3)(12) = 8; r = (5/6)(12) = 10; s = (3/5)(10) = 6
    Quantity 1 = 4s = 4(6) = 24; Quantity 2 = 3q =3(8) = 24

    Both Ronald and Victoria started from the racing point and covered a distance of 200 Kilometers. Ronald is running at the speed of 10 kilometers per hour, while Victoria is running at the speed of 15 kilometers per hour. Determine who reached first.
        Ronald came first
        Both reached at the same time
        Victoria reached first
        No relation 

    Ans : C

    Explanation:
    Ronald is driving at the speed of 10 kilometers per hour so he reaches in 4 hours, while Victoria is running at a speed of 15 kilometers per hour per hour, so he reaches in 2.5 hours;
    Hence (c) is the correct answer.

    Quantity 1: 5/126
    Quantity 2: 0.35/8
        Quantity 1 is greater than Quantity 2
        Quantity 2 is greater than Quantity 1
        There is no relation between both the quantities
        Both quantities are equal 

    Ans : B

    Explanation:

    Assume that quantity 1 is (a) and quantity 2 is 15. Determine whether
        Quantity 1 is greater than Quantity 2
        Quantity 2 is greater than Quantity 1
        Both the quantities are equal
        The relationship between the two quantities cannot be determined 

    Ans : C

    Explanation:
    As quantity 1 = a = 3b + 6
    = 3 (3) + 6
    = 9 + 6
    = 15 = quantity 2.
    Therefore the answer is (c).

    A + 3B >10
    Quantity 1: 3A + 6B
    Quantity 2: 24
        Quantity 2 is greater than Quantity 1
        Both the quantities are equal
        Quantity 1 is greater than Quantity 2
        The relationship between the two quantities cannot be determined 

    Ans : D

    Explanation:
    A + 3B > 10
    Hence, A > 10 – 3B
    Multiplying by 3 to both sides of inequality,
    3A > 30-9B
    Hence, 3A + 9B > 30
    Now Q1: 3A + 6B
    Q2: 24
    Hence, there is no Connection between these two.
    Option (d) is the answer.

    B = 7/8 + 2/65
        B is greater than A
        A is greater than B
        There is no relationship between A and B
        A is equal to B 

    Ans : B

    Explanation:
    A = 6-3/27 = 3/27 = 0.1111
    B = 7/8 + 2/65 = 0.0442 + 0.0312 = 0.0754
    Therefore A is greater than B.

    X = 0.35
    Y = 0.41 / 3
        X is greater than Y
        Y is greater than X
        X is equal to Y
        There is no relation between X and Y 

    Ans : A

    Explanation:
    Y = 0.42 / 3 = 0.14, whereas X = 0.35.
    Therefore X is greater than Y.

    a + b = 15
    Quantity 1: 15
    Quantity 2: a – b
        Quantity 1 is equal to Quantity 2
        Quantity 2 is greater than Quantity 1
        No relation
        Quantity 1 is greater than quantity 2 

    Ans : C

    Explanation:
    As quantity 1 is 15 = a + b and quantity 2 is a – b,
    Option (c) is the right answer.

    Quantity A: (1/70) 3 + (1/2058) 4
    Quantity B: (2/70) + (3/56)
        Quantity A is smaller than Quantity B
        There is no relation between both the quantities
        Quantity B is smaller than Quantity A
        Quantity A = Quantity B 

    Ans : B

    Explanation:
    Quantity A is the cube root of both the quantities and then division, where as quantity B is just division, hence there is no relation between two quantities.
