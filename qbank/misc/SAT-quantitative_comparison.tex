    Q2: 24

    Hence, there is no relation between these two.

    Option (d) is the answer

    F = 2/w + 2/c = 2/6

    A = 2/w2 + 2/c2 = 7/9

        F and A are equal
        F> A
        F< A
        Relation not defined

    Answer: (d)

    Explanation: N = 2/w2 + 2/c2 = 7/9 = 1/w2 + 1/c2 = 7/18

    M = 2/w + 2/c = 2/6 = 1/w + 1/c = 1/6

    M2 = 1/w2 + 2/wc + 1/c2 = 1/36

    M2 = 1/w2 + 1/c2 =1/36 - 2/wc

    Therefore the relation between F and A is not defined.
