(c) Either (1) or (2) follows
(d) Neither (1) nor (2) follows
(e) Both (1) and (2) follows

Answer: (b)

Clarification: Undoubtedly, the sentence should be completely negative and it should not have the middle term. So, it goes like â€œ'No mango is cheapâ€. As all mangoes are golden in color, we may alternate 'mangoes' with 'golden-colored mangoes'. Therefore, 2 follows.

Question 4:

Sentences:

1.All kings are beautiful.
2.All queens are kings.
(a) Only Sentence 1 follows

(b) Only Conclusion 2 follows
(c) Either 1 or 2 follows
(d) Neither 1 nor 2 follows
(e) Both 1 and 2 follows

As the center term is not distributed even at least once in the sentence, therefore no exact conclusion follows.
