%% Learning Objectives
%%--------------------------------------------------

%% 37.01: Identify the two postulates of (special) relativity and the type of frames to which they apply.
%% 37.02: Identify the speed of light as the ultimate speed and give its approximate value.
%% 37.03: Explain how the space and time coordinates of an event can be measured with a three-dimensional array of clocks and measuring rods and how that eliminates the need of a signal's travel time to an observer.
%% 37.04: Identify that the relativity of space and time has to do with transferring measurements between two inertial frames with relative motion but we still use classical kinematics and Newtonian mechanics within a frame.
%% 37.05: Identify that for reference frames with relative motion, simultaneous events in one of the frames will generally not be simultaneous in the other frame.
%% 37.06: Explain what is meant by the entanglement of the spatial and temporal separations between two events.
%% 37.07: Identify the conditions in which a temporal separation of two events is a proper time.
%% 37.08: Identify that if the temporal separation of two events is a proper time as measured in one frame, that separation is greater (dilated) as measured in another frame.
%% 37.09: Apply the relationship between proper time $\Delta t_0$, dilated time $\Delta t$, and the relative speed $v$ between two frames.
%% 37.10: Apply the relationship between the relative speed $v$, the speed parameter $\beta$, and the Lorentz factor $\gamma$.
