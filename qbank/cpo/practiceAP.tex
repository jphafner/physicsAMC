    A free-body diagram includes vectors representing the individual forces acting on an object.
    Which of these quantities should \emph{not} appear on a free-body diagram?

    A \SI{0.30}{\kilo\gram} bird is flying from right to left at \SI{30}{\meter\per\second}.
    The bird collides with and sticks to a \SI{0.50}{\kilo\gram} ball
        which is moving straight up with speed \SI{6.0}{\meter\per\second}.
    What is the magnitude of the momentum of the ball/bird combination immediately after collision?

    An object rolls along level ground to the right at constant speed.
    Must there be any forces pushing this object to the right?
    \begin{choices}
        \wrongchoice{Yes: the \emph{only} force that act must be to the right.}
        \wrongchoice{Yes: but there could also be a friction force to the left.}
        \wrongchoice{No: no forces can act to the right.}
      \correctchoice{No: while there can be forces acting, no net force \emph{must} act.}
        \wrongchoice{The answer depends on the speed of the object.}
