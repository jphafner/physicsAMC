-[ ] create new category: NYSED-physicalOptics


-[ ] Check physics labs for categorization??

-[ ] modern should have relativity and standard model, or split relativity into separate??

-[ ] make NYSED-atomic, take from modern, also NYSED-nuclear
-[ ] NYSED-atomic: electron orbitals, chemistry, spectroscopy, and photoelectric effect??

-[ ] make NYSED-oscillations?? is this harmonic??

-[ ] split internalEnergy into (heat and temperature), (kinetic theory) and thermodynamics

-[ ] why no fluids??

-[ ] split gravity into gravity and orbits ??

-[ ] split NYSED-momentum into impulse and momentum (conservation principle) ??

-[ ] nuclearEnergy into nuclearEnergy and nuclear.

-[ ] split use Group 4---Atomic and Nuclear Physics into nuclear and atomic

## See above
-[ ] split NYSED-light -> lightRayModel and lightWaveModel (color) and lightPhoton (move from atomic)
-[ ] split NYSED-light -> color 

-[ ] split NYSED-newton -> newton1, newton2, newton3, freeBody 
-[ ] split NYSED-newton -> newton1 and freeBody (with friction)

-[ ] split NYSED-electrostatics -> NYSED-coulomb/charge/electricity??,   capacitators?? 



-[ ] Learning Objectives in each file, refer to heller and heller and kelly oshea
-[ ] Use phycoresci.pdf as example
-[ ] Make reference to misconceptions


## Examples

-[ ] Differentiate between scalar and vector quantity
-[ ] Represent motion graphically and algebraically and solve one dimensional uniformly accelerating 
-[ ] Decompose a vector into orthogonal components
-[ ] Differentiate between displacement and distance
-[ ] Differentiate betweeen displacmenet, velocity and acceration
-[ ] Solve algebraically ...
