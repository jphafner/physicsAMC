\begin{question}{2004-APB-Q13}
    A block with mass $m_1$ is pulled by a rope with tension $T$
        along the ground as shown in the figure where the coefficient
        of kinetic friction between the ground and the block is $\mu_k$.
    On top of this block is another block of mass $m_2$ which is moving
        in the same direction as $m_1$ but sliding relative to $m_1$
        in the opposite direction.
    The coefficient of friction between the two blocks is $\mu_k$.
    Which of the following can be a free body diagram for block 2?

\begin{question}{2004-APB-Q13}
    In the following figure containing an inclined plane and a pulley,
        the angle of the incline is $\theta$ and the coefficient
        of static friction between $m_1$ and the inclined plane
        is $\mu_s$.
    Initially, all the masses are at rest and the angle $\theta$
        is slowly increased starting from zero.
    At the critical angle $\theta=\theta_C$, $m_1$ accelerates in
        the positive $\bar{x}$ direction.
    Express $\mu_s$ in terms of $\theta_C$, $m_1$ and $m_2$.
    \begin{choices}
      \correctchoice{$\frac{m_1 g \sin\theta_C - m_2 g}{m_1 g \cos\theta_C}$}
