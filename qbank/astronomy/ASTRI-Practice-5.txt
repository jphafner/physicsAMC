Practice Exam for ASTR II,  EXAM 5 on Cosmology

 

 

    Which one of the following is the most complete statement of the Cosmological Principle?

 

        the universe appears the same to all observers
        the appearance of the universe depends on the direction of observation
        on a large scale, the universe appears the same to all observers
        the universe is unchanging throughout all time
        the distribution of matter is uniform, but the appearance depends on the direction of observation

 

    Which of the following are possible universes according to the solutions of Einstein’s equations for the geometry of the universe?

 

        open
        closed
        flat
        a and b only
        a, b, and c

 

    A universe with a positive curvature is considered a

 

        closed universe
        open universe
        static universe
        flat universe

 

    The critical density for the universe is

 

        the density of matter in the Milky Way
        the density at which an object becomes a black hole
        the number density of galaxies in a typical cluster of galaxies
        the density at the center of the Big Bang
        the density of a flat universe

 

    If the density of the universe is greater than the critical density, the universe will

 

        continue to expand forever
        eventually stop expanding
        eventually stop expanding and begin contraction
        continue to contract forever
        eventually stop contracting and begin expanding

 

    The critical density is roughly

 

        the density of air at sea level on Earth
        the density at the center of the Sun
        the density of a white dwarf
        the density of the interstellar medium (~ 1 proton per cubic centimeter)
        about 1 proton per cubic meter

 

    The density of the observable matter in the universe indicates that the universe is

 

        open
        closed
        flat
        static

 

    To determine whether the expansion of the universe is decelerating or accelerating requires

 

        observing very faint galaxies
        observing very bright galaxies
        observing nearby galaxies
        observing the motions of binary galaxies
        observing the microwave background radiation

 

    A large amount of deuterium in the universe would mean the universe is

 

        open
        closed
        flat
        static

 

    What percentage of the mass of the universe was formed into helium during the Big Bang?

 

        1%
        5%
        10%
        25%
        50%

 

    The temperature of the universe 1 second after the Big Bang was approximately

 

        10 (to the 6th power) K
        10 (to the 8th power) K
        10 (to the 10th power) K
        10 (to the 15th power) K
        10 (to the 20th power) K

 

    The assumption that the general structure of the universe is the same everywhere is the assumption of

 

        isotropy
        homogeneity
        regularity
        universality
        constancy

 

    When we observe distant galaxies we are observing

 

        very young objects
        very old objects
        objects having the approximate age of the Milky Way
        distant galaxies; no statement may be made about age

 

    Except for hydrogen, the most abundant element formed in the Big Bang was

 

        helium
        lithium
        oxygen
        carbon
        nitrogen

 

    Deuterium in the universe was produced

 

        by fusion in stellar interiors
        by fission in stellar interiors
        during the initial Big Bang
        by high density radiation near stars
        none of the above, it only exists on the Earth

 

    Olbers’ paradox results from asking the question

 

        What is truth?
        What is a quasar?
        What is the nature of the Universe?
        Why is the night sky dark?
        What am I doing here?

 

    A difficulty with inflationary models of the universe is that they fail to explain

 

        where the universe came from
        the origin of life
        the formation of the solar system
        how galaxies, clusters and superclusters formed
        the origin of the microwave background radiation

 

    Grand Unified Theories connect all but which one of the four forces in nature?

 

        gravity
        electromagnetism
        weak nuclear
        strong nuclear
